This study investigates whether economic factors influencing monthly unemployment rates in the US differ during financial crises. It employs regression analysis to examine the relationship between unemployment rates and variables such as monthly GDP growth, inflation rate, labor force participation rate, presidential party, and immigration data.

Objective: Measure the impact of economic crises on women and men unemployment rates around the event window, taking into account of major economic indicators and president party affiliation.

Methods: We performed various data exploration, visual analysis and OLS multiple regression analysis to analyze abnormal changes in unemployment rates in crisis. We also performed various diagnostics to assess the fit and robustness of the regression models.

Hypothesis: 
Null Hypothesis (H0): Economic crises do not cause abnormal changes in women and men unemployment rates, respectively, aftering controlling for major economic indicators and president party affiliation.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Economic crises cause abnormal changes in women and men unemployment rates, respectively, aftering controlling for major economic indicators and president party affiliation.

Conclusion:
We are able to reject the null hypothesis that economic crises do not cause abnormal changes in women and men unemployment rates, respectively, aftering controlling for major economic indicators and president party affiliation.
